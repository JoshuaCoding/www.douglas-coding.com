<h1>My First Website</h1>
<h2>How I Did it</h2>
<p> My name is Josh, Grade 8, and this is my first website. I have learned using one method,<strong>HTML</strong>. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is the code you use for website design and other website based activities.</p>

<h3>How I learned Coding</h3>
</div>

<p> I learn HTML using a cool website called CodeAcademy. All you do is sign-up and you start a free course for all types of coding like:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Java</li>
</ul>
If you want to learn more, click the hyper link that says "Learn More".

<h2>The Platform I Used</h2>
</div>
<p> After getting a basis knowledge on HTML I had to apply it in a real platform. I search all over the internet and I had finally found a practicing platform. It is called JSFiddle. JSFiddle is a cool website that when you sign up, you can practice your coding on a actual platform.<a
